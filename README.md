The new Pet App

The second edition for our "PAWW" app. The development is still in progress.

For the current progress, we started with Android and Google firebase as our database solution. I did a lot of research online for Android studio to teach myself how to code a mobile app. Although I learn basic knowledge of JAVA and Android studio from school, it feels totally different when I’m actually building an app instead of doing class assignments. We are using Agile methodology to balance everyone’s workflow and will soon split the team to work on IOS platform.
